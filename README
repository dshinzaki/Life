Experiment into pygame and algorithms associated with Conway's Game of Life
- Contains 2 classes which implement the Game of Life on a predefined finite universe, BasicLife and NeighborLife. NeighborLife is optimized using a change list and an array of live neighbor counts to save time.
- Contains a class which implements the Game of Life for a potentially infinite universe, HashmapLife. HashmapLife is optimized using a change list and an list of live neighbor counts to save time.
- Contains interfaceLife.py an visual interface for playing the Game of Life on a finite, wrap-around universe.
- Example execution: python [-O] interfaceLife.py
